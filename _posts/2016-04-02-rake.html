Organizing data analysis is hard. Here's a couple reasons it gets
tricky:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>You have thousands of files</dt><dd>You can work with a single CSV file
by hand. Maybe you could do a dozen, but you're not going to be
able to keep track of thousands of files. You can't even count
them without some sort of tool.</dd>
<dt>Data collection is ongoing</dt><dd>Not only do you have a bunch of
files, but you keep getting more. Somehow you need to keep
everything up-to-date with the latest data dump.</dd>
<dt>You want to be reproducible</dt><dd>You'd like anybody to be able to
download your analysis and run it on their machine.
Unfortunately, running it on your machine is often an ordeal.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Fortunately, there's a solution for all of these problems. You
should use a tool called rake.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">What is Rake?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
Rake is a build utility; build utilities were originally designed to
automate the process of compiling code from source. You can
generalize the process to simply updating files based upon
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at how rake address the problems with organizing data analysis
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>You have thousands of files</dt><dd>No problem, you can handle
everything programmatically. Rake will handle the tedious stuff.</dd>
<dt>Data collection is ongoing</dt><dd>Once your workflow is defined,
processing new data doesn't require anything more than typing a
single rake command into your shell. If you want to get really
fancy, you don't even have to type it, you can automate the
process using a chron job.</dd>
<dt>You want to be reproducible</dt><dd>Rake doesn't work well if you're
not explicit about your workflow. The benefit of this is that,
if it runs, it's probably reproducible (assuming you dealt with
stuff like seeding your PRNG).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I use rake for all of my projects. Perhaps the most useful is my
work on neuroscience data. I need to manage a bunch of brain
recordings, preprocess them, and then run some analysis. The lab
manages this process by hand and it takes up a lot of their time. My
system is automated, so whenever I update my methods or get new data
it's a simple matter of typing one command and then coming back a
couple minutes (or hours depending) later to look at the results.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3">An example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
To see how rake works, it's best to look at an example. Let's work
with <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">baby name data from the SSA</a>. The SSA, by virtue of issuing
social security cards, has a list of baby names for each year. What
we want to do is look at the number of babies with a particular name
plotted over time. Are certain names getting more or less popular?
How many kids are named Elvis?
</p>

<p>
Rake requires that you have a specific file in your project
directory named "Rakefile". This is where you specify your workflow.
So let's walk through an example Rakefile.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">Step 1</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
Our first step is downloading the data from the SSA's website. We
can achieve this with the following entry in our Rakefile.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby">file <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/raw/names.zip"</span> =&gt; [] <span style="color: #4c83ff;">do</span> |t|
  mkdir_p <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/raw"</span>
  sh <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"wget https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip -O data/raw/names.zip"</span>
<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <i>file</i> at the start indicates that I'm denoting a file task
(we'll get to the other types). /"names.zip"/ is the file that I'm
creating, the "<i>=&gt; []</i>" syntax is used to express dependencies
(more on that later). The code included within the <i>do-end</i> block
is the action I take to create my file, namely make the directory
and download the file from the SSA website. You can use any ruby
command within the block; here I use the built-in system tools to
make the "data/raw" directory and then run my shell command.
</p>

<p>
To execute this I simply run "rake data/raw/names.zip" in the same
directory as my Rakefile. Note that once the file has been created,
nothing happens when I repeat the command. The only time that rake
executes a task is when the target doesn't exist or one of its
dependencies is newer than the existing target file. You'll never
repeat unnecessary work.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">Step 2</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
The zip file that I've downloaded contains a bunch of text files of
the form /yob****.txt" which contain the names data for a certain
year. To extract these I can make a task
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby">directory <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/processed"</span>

yob_files = <span style="color: #afd8af;">FileList</span>[(1880..2014).map{|year| <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/processed/yob</span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{year}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;">.txt"</span>}]

yob_files.each <span style="color: #4c83ff;">do</span> |yob_file|
  file yob_file =&gt; [<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/raw/names.zip"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/processed"</span>] <span style="color: #4c83ff;">do</span> |t|
    sh <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"unzip -DD data/raw/names.zip -d data/processed"</span>
  <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first thing that I do is define a directory task.
</p>

<p>
We then make a list of all of the text files we want to extract.
Here we make this list by taking each year between 1880 and 2014
and mapping it to the relevent file name. We then store it as a
FileList, a structure which is simply a list of filenames which
have some nice methods defined on it for ease of use.
</p>

<p>
We then iterate through this list of filenames and make file tasks
for each one. The body is the same for each, running <i>unzip</i> on the
zip file.
</p>

<p>
When we run rake, the zip file will only be unzipped once since
rake checks to see if a task is necessary before running. Remember,
a task only runs if the target doesn't exist or one of its
dependencies is newer than the existing target file. Note that we
need to make sure the timestamps work out by using the "-DD" flag,
otherwise the timestamps for our unzipped files will be behind the
timestamp of the zipped file.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6">Step 3</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
Working with all of the txt files is going to be painful. So our
next step is consolidate them into a single csv file.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby">file <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/single-file.csv"</span> =&gt; [*yob_files, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"code/make-single-file.R"</span>] <span style="color: #4c83ff;">do</span> |t|
  sh <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"Rscript code/make-single-file.R --outfile </span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{t.name}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;"> --yob_files </span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{yob_files}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;">"</span>
<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now that we've gotten used to the syntax, this step is fairly
self-explanatory. 
</p>

<p>
Passing arguments to R is a little different though. You definitely
want to make use of the argparse package. Otherwise, parsing the
command line options in the above script is difficult since the
number of txt files is variable.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline7">Step 4</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
Now for the final product. We want to make some graphs.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby"><span style="color: #4c83ff;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff1493;">make_plot</span>(name, sex, outfile)
  dir = directory outfile.pathmap(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"%d"</span>)
  file outfile =&gt; [<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"code/plot-name-by-year.R"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"data/single-file.csv"</span>, dir] <span style="color: #4c83ff;">do</span> |t|
    sh <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"Rscript code/plot-name-by-year.R --name </span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{name}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;"> --sex </span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{sex}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;"> --infile data/single-file.csv --outfile </span><span style="color: #ff69b4;">#{outfile}</span><span style="color: #61CE3C;">"</span>
  <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
  multitask <span style="color: #96CBFE;">:make_plots</span> =&gt; outfile
<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>

make_plot(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"Amelia"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"F"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"figs/amelia.pdf"</span>)
make_plot(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"Elvis"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"M"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"figs/elvis.pdf"</span>)
make_plot(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"John"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"M"</span>, <span style="color: #61CE3C;">"figs/john.pdf"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We have full use of the ruby language, so we can define functions.
This saves us a lot of copy-and-pasting.
</p>

<p>
We also can run our tasks in parallel. The multitask token
indicates a task which can be done in parallel. This speeds things
up considerably.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline8">End Result</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
Anybody can replicate our figures just by downloading our source
code and running the following command.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">rake make_plots
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then rake will download the file, do the pre-processing, and make
the figures (in parallel) automatically. It's great.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline9">A word of caution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
If you've read this far down, you're probably interested in using
rake in your own work. Let me warn you about something.
</p>

<p>
This is very much a tool for managing <b>your</b> computational flow.
There's the definite potential for things to spiral out of control
when you start collaborating with others. Here's a short list of
potential problems and solutions.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Your collaborator doesn't know ruby
</p>

<p>
This is fairly common; ruby is not a standard stats/math language.
For people who don't find learning languages fun, there's little
reason to have heard of ruby, let alone have learned how to use
it.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately it's not too hard to teach them the basic syntax
required to make simple tasks (it's just as easy as Make). You
should take the lead on anything complex.
</p></li>

<li><p>
You have incompatable systems / packages
</p>

<p>
This happened to me when a munging script that worked perfectly
fine on my machine started spewing errors on my collaborators
machine. It took me longer than I'd like to publicly admit to
realize that the problem was that on my machine the command
<code>python</code> refers to <code>python3</code> while on his machine it refers to
<code>python2</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is easy fixed by making sure you have the same packages on
all machines. Or if some machines can't run certain programs
(ahem, matlab) then just work around it as much as you can.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Your collaborator doesn't use the command line
</p>

<p>
View this as an opportunity; you can initiate them into the
mysteries of the command line.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Your collaborator doesn't use Linux
</p>

<p>
This is the worst case scenario. My understanding is that you
should be mostly ok with OS X. Windows seems like it would be a
nightmare (but maybe it'll work now that <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/16/03/30/1021224/confirmed-microsoft-and-canonical-partner-to-bring-ubuntu-to-windows-10">bash is coming to
Windows</a>). I haven't really dealt with this, but the solution is
obvious: "borrow" their machine and install linux. Eventually
they'll come around and thank you.
