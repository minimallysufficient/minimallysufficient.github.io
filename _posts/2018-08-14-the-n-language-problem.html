title: The N Language Problem
excerpt: The two-language problem is annoying; but once you write your code you end up facing the N language problem.

The Julia <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero">1.0 release</a> is here, it's really finally here! But for all
my Julia enthusiasm, I generally don't use it for my academic work.
And I don't expect that will change soon (although I'd love for that
to happen). The reason why is what I call the "N language problem".
</p>

<p>
First we should discuss the two language problem. A motivation behind
Julia was solving this problem: you prototype in a slow high level
language before writing production code in a performant low level
language. This approach jointly minimizes programmer time and
computational time, but clearly it's sub-optimal to write the code
twice. Julia's goal is that <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia">we can be greedy</a> and get both ease of
development and performance.
</p>

<p>
But that's not the whole picture. Somewhat orthogonal to two language
problem is the N language problem: you want your code to be used by
the community. And if you want the statistics community to use your
code it had better be an R package. Or if you want scientists to use
your code it had better be a python package (or /*gasp/* a Matlab
"package?"). Or javascript, or go, or Java, or whatever language.
</p>

<p>
In a fantasy world everyone switches to Julia and it rules as the one
True language. This seems unworkable and even perhaps undesirable.
There are reasons why we have so many languages in the first place. So
what are we to do?
</p>

<p>
I encountered this problem while working on my latest project on
random forests for conditional density estimation. My statistical
collaborators mostly just use R. But our application area is astronomy
and for them if it's not in python then it doesn't exist. While I
could write two versions, that seems unsustainable especially if we
want to include more application areas with their own languages (i.e.
I shudder at the thought of writing a Matlab port). My solution was
writing a C++ library and then wrappers for both R and python.
</p>

<p>
This is, effectively, just embracing the two language paradigm.
Importantly though, it does so in a way that solves the N language
problem.
</p>

<p>
For example, Rcpp is a great tool, but it's easy to end up with a "one
language" solution. Having so much power to work with R's internal
data structures diminishes the ability to port to another language.
You're not coding in C++, you're coding in Rcpp and that's going to
cause problems when you want to port to a new language.
</p>

<p>
What you have to do is write in such a way that you're agnostic to R's
data structures. So none of Rcpp's syntactic sugar and no R-specific
types. That way when you switch to python you can use the same code
with just some new wrapper code.
</p>

<p>
There's still the pain point of writing in C++. But if it lets you
avoid writing significant code in several other languages you still
come out ahead. I wrote the C++ code for the R version of RFCDE and
got the python version for free.
</p>

<p>
Ideally you would end up replacing C++ with something like Julia. I
know I would have loved to write RFCDE in Julia rather than C++. But
we're not there yet. But it would be great to see some progress
towards that goal.
</p>

<p>
The N language problem is only going to get worse, at least in the
statistics/data science field. The best thing you can say about the R
language is that it has nearly every statistical method ever invented
implemented by some package on CRAN. And that most statisticians use
it. But as a language, it leaves a lot to be desired. And good luck
convincing other fields to adopt it.
</p>

<p>
But with the lock-in implicitly created by CRAN, there's almost no
other choice. If all of those methods had been implemented in C we
could use them in almost any language we wanted. But also if they had
to be implemented in C we probably wouldn't have nearly as many
packages as we do.
</p>

<p>
So what we need is a new "low-level" wrappable language. I hope it's
Julia, but I'd jump ship in a heartbeat if I found something that
could solve this problem better.
