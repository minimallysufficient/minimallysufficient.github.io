Before passing along my copy<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> of Flatland to my brother (as he
needs it for a class), I reread it on an airplane. It turns out that
airplanes are the best environment in which to read this book. It's
fortunate that nobody was sitting beside me and asked what I was
reading because they would have gotten the following lecture. You,
dear reader, are not as lucky<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

<h2 id="orgheadline1">Flatland</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
Firstly a short synopsis of the book. It was written in 1884 by a
schoolteacher/theologian Edwin Abbott Abbott<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. You're
introduced to a geometrical world from the perspective of "A
Square", who is a square inhabiting a two-dimensional manifold. He
describes life in two-dimensions and then is visited by a
three-dimensional sphere who introduces him to a one-dimensional
line world (and a zero-dimensional point world) and eventually shows
him the third-dimension. There's also a good deal more to it,
including commentary on Victorian society and metaphysical musings.
It's very short, so there's no reason not to read the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">entire thing</a>.
For those who prefer a movie, apparently such a thing exists and
actually has Martin Sheen and Kristen Bell as voice actors; I don't
know how well it tracks the book, but the <a href="http://www.flatlandthemovie.com/">trailer</a> is certainly
surreal.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Spherical Geometry</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
So what does air travel have to do with anything? It's all about
geometry. It turns out the spherical geometry is rather strange..
Here's just a few of the "obvious" geometrical intuitions that not
necessarily true on a sphere.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline3">The shortest distance between two points is a line.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
This first is actually true, but it's misleading. When you draw a
line on a map<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> it's not actually the shortest path between
the two points. In fact, for a sphere the "lines" are <i>great
circles</i>. These are just the paths you would take if you kept
walking perfectly straight (from your perspective) until you
returned to your starting location; any such path is called a
geodesic. All shortest paths are geodesics but not all geodesics
are shortest paths. You can see this in spherical geometry because
while great circles are geodesics, we can choose to go clockwise or
counterclockwise around the great circle.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">Two points determine a line</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
Not necessarily. Consider the North and South pole. There are
infinitely many lines of longitude (which are great circles)
extending between the two. In fact any two points which are
<i>antipodal</i>, on the exact opposite side of the sphere, will work.
If the points aren't antipodal then only two are required.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">There are such things as parallel lines</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
This is not the case. One common objection is that lines of
latitude do not intersect. Looking back at the definition of a
line, we see that only great circles are lines and thus lines of
latitude are not lines (in the spherical geometry sense).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6">The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
This is where things start getting very interesting. To show that
this is not true a simple counter-example will suffice. You might
want to obtain a globe and perform this example for it to sink in.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Start at the intersection of the equator and the prime-meridian. Walk
counter-clockwise along the equator a quarter of the way around the
globe. Turn left. Walk until you reach the North Pole. Turn left. Walk
until you reach the equator at which point you turn left again and
you're facing the same direction you started.
</pre>

<p>
However we turned left three times which results in a sum of
interior angles of 270°.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that this is very interesting. We can measure this as
the angular defect defined as the difference between the sum of the
angles (in radians) minus the usual value of &pi;.. There are several
things that can be proven about this, the first of which is that
it's non-negative. All triangles on a sphere have sum of angles
greater than 180°.
</p>

<p>
We can go further and show<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. that the area of the triangle
is the same as the angular defect (for a sphere of radius 1, you
just scale by \(r^{2}\) otherwise) and hence trivially prove the
previous non-negativity result.

<h2 id="orgheadline7">"Some yet more spacious Space, some more dimensionable Dimensionality"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
Perhaps what I most love about Flatland is that it enthusiastically
keeps going. You could have gotten a lot of the satire and novelty
out of the story of introducing "A Square" to the third dimension.
However, Abbot doesn't stop there. Instead he follows the obvious
extrapolation and has "A Square" postulate the existence of a 4th
and 5th dimension, indeed an entire infinite sequence of dimensions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland and see
the inside of all things, so of a certainly there is yet above us
some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead
me - O Thou Whome I shall always call everywhere and in all
Dimensions, my Priest, Philosopher, and Friend - some yet more
spacious Space, some more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the
vantage-ground of which we shall look down together upon the
revealed insides of solid things, and where thine own intestines,
and those of thy kindred Spheres, will lie exposed to the View of
the poor wandering exile from Flatland, to whome so much has
already been vouchsafed.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Taking that example to my spherical geometry case, what would be the
next extension? Suppose instead of a sphere, we were flying on a
donut or in mathematical terms a torus. The first thing that comes
to mind with a torus is that there are infinitely many geodesics
which connect any two distinct points. For a simple example take two
points on the outer circle of the torus. You can connect them with a
straight line along the circumference. Or you can connect them with
a looped line that goes around the ring once, or twice, or three
times, or however many times you want. All are geodesics and all
connect the two points.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the torus also brings up another interesting point:
topology<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>. Abbot describes Flatland as a piece of paper.
What would be another difference if the Flatlanders lived on a
torus? For one, they wouldn't have hard edges to their world. They'd
also find that walking the same direction is faster in some places
than others, namely when they're on the inside or outside of the
hole (from our perspective).
</p>

<p>
This branches out into figuring out what kinds of surfaces can be
distinguished by Flatlanders using <i>intrinsic geometry</i>, geometry
that uses only measurements that can be performed on the surface,
not using the 3rd dimension. This is especially interesting if you
consider that we're in a putatively 4-dimensional space and
necessarily need to use intrinsic geometry to figure out what kind
of space we're in. Experiments have shown that we don't live in a
Euclidean space, rather we live in a far more interesting curved
space-time.
