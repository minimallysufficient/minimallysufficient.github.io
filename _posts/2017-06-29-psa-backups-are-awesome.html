<p>
Last summer I accidentally left my <a href="http://minimallysufficient.github.io/2015/11/21/using-a-chromebook-as-a-primary-computing-device.html">Chromebook</a> power cord on the wrong
side of the country and had to wait a few weeks to get it back. Since
I was traveling without my "real" laptop I was without a machine. It
was an idyllic time during which I contemplated my relationship with
technology. But this post is not about that, it's about what happens
after I plug my Chromebook back in and realize everything is gone.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that if your Chromebook completely exhausts its battery
it disables legacy boot mode and has to boot into ChromeOS. Well, I
had wiped ChromeOS to replace it with Linux so I have to wipe the
drive again and reinstall ChromeOS. My files were not spared in this
process.
</p>

<p>
However, this story has a happy ending. I lost almost nothing. Code
and text for my projects is saved on Github while raw data is stored
on my "real" laptop and on a cloud storage service. The only real loss
was the time it would take to reinstall Linux and my favorite
software.
</p>

<p>
This could have been a nightmare however. As someone whose work is
mostly code, suddenly having it all disappear would be a serious
matter. While the probability of such a loss seems fairly low (this is
the first time I've ever lost anything), the magnitude is large enough
that it's worthwhile to protect against it. Fortunately, that's fairly
easy to do.
</p>

<p>
For code/text there's nothing better than Github. As a student I have
access to free unlimited private<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> repos so I store
everything: problem sets, research, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> solutions, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of
Code</a> solutions, Backup is as easy as a commit and push. Even better,
because it's a version control system you never have to worry about
overwriting something; you have access to all previous versions. Git
isn't even as complicated as people make it out to be; as long as you
restrict yourself to `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` I can't
think of anything that can reasonably go wrong. You're not getting the
collaborative benefits and your log might get messy, but you probably
have the best plain text backup system available.
</p>

<p>
You'll need another tool when you have files that aren't plain text;
usually this is raw data and figures. The figures generally don't need
to be saved; if your project is reproducible you can simply <a href="http://minimallysufficient.github.io/2016/04/02/rake.html">regenerate</a>
these files as necessary. But for data, or computationally intensive
figures you'll need something other than Github to store them.
</p>

<p>
The most popular solution among people I know is Dropbox <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
My main problem with Dropbox is that managing files requires either
using the web interface or saving files in a particular directory. To
be clear, this is mostly an aesthetic problem for me. I solve this by
using <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>. It's like rsync except you can access Dropbox and
several other cloud services. So backing up my library of papers/notes
is as easy as `rclone sync papers dropbox:papers`. It also works with
Google Drive with `rclone sync papers gdrive:papers` in case you want
to diversify your storage.
</p>

<p>
That's basically all you need to avoid the heartbreak of losing your
work. The amazing thing is that they're not particularly onerous. You
should already be using git and if you're not it's fairly simple to
learn the basics. Dropbox can sync automatically or you can write a
cron job to do so. Losing your data shouldn't worry you.
