title: Fun with Grad Cafe data

<p>
My classmate <a href="http://www.statisticalsignal.com/">Lee Richardson</a> and I were discussing the website <a href="http://thegradcafe.com/">GradCafe</a>
last night and their database of admissions decisions. This morning he
sent me a link to an R package <a href="http:://cran.r-project.org/package=brewdata">brewdata</a> which scrapes results off the
site, cleans it, and puts it into a nice R dataframe.
</p>

<p>
Because I have nothing better to do <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> I decided to have some
fun with the data.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1">Warnings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This data is cool, but it's a non-probability sample. That means
that any conclusions we might draw don't necessarily
generalize<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> to the broader population of applicants to
statistics programs.</li>
<li>Don't take this as an endorsement of GradCafe. If you're currently
in the process of waiting for admissions decisions, under no
circumstances should you look at GradCafe. Relax, enjoy your
senior year of college or current job, and know that anxiously
refreshing your browser to see the latest news does nothing for
your admissions chances.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">The Data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
I'm going to focus on 2014 data which has data on 589 applications.
</p>

<p>
To enable me to answer some of the questions I'm going to try and
identify unique individuals. To do this I used the reported GPA and
GRE scores to pick out individuals. If two records share the same
GPA and GRE scores then I declare them to be from the same
individual. This gives me 128 individuals with a total of 241
applications to 62 schools.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6">Questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline6">

<h3 id="orgheadline3">When do you hear back?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
Part of the reason why I suggest that people avoid looking at
GradCafe during admissions seasons is that it leads to anxiety. The
longer you wait and the more acceptances you see on the website,
the more likely you expect to be denied. Equipped with data, we can
examine the veracity of this belief.
</p>

<pre class="example">
   
     A  I  O  R  W
Apr  1  0  0  8  0
Dec  6  0  0  0  0
Feb 57  3  0 64  7
Jan 23  3  0 18  1
Mar 23  0  2 20  5
May  1  0  0  0  0
</pre>

<p>
As we see, if you're lucky enough to get a response in December
you're sure to be admitted. January is still early and has more
acceptances than rejections. February and March have more
rejections, but not dramatically so. Sad to say, April doesn't hold
much hope.
</p>

<p>
So it seems that waiting for a response isn't necessarily a sign of
disappointment. Just don't wait too long.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">How many places do people apply to?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
When I was in the middle of application season I heard a couple
different approaches to choosing which schools to apply to. Some
people preferred the "shotgun" approach of applying to as many
schools as possible in order to "maximize" their likelihood of
acceptance. Personally I went with the "only apply if you would
want to go there" approach, but I am curious which approach
dominates.
</p>

<p>
It seems that the majority of Grad Cafe participants apply to only
one school. I suspected that this is not actually true, rather
people are only reporting the school at which they were admitted
and accepted. However, 39 out of the 85 individuals that applied to
only one school were denied.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/applications.png" alt="applications.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of course, I would be remiss from confirming the obvious. The
correlation between acceptances and applications is \(0.6639914\). To
borrow from Gretzsky, "You get denied at 100% of the schools you
don't apply to."

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">How important are GRE scores?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Since we're having fun, I'll fit a logistic regression to see how
important grades and test scores. Don't put any stock into the
statistical significance of GPA.

<pre class="example">

glm(formula = (decision == "A") ~ scale(gpa) + scale(gre_v) +

</pre>

<p>
I don't particularly like this model, specifically the linearity of
the scores. I imagine that a cutoff model would be more
appropriate. However, this means little when considering the larger
issue: omitted variable bias. We have no data on letters of
recommendation, previous research experiences, undergrad
institution, etc. I suspect that these have a larger impact on
admission decisions than test scores.

<p>
This gets to a greater questions: how random are grad school
admissions? The data that we have available is a good summary of
some of the objective measures of applications: GPA and test scores.
But there's all of the subjective aspects to consider. This reminds
me of the <a href="http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html">NIPS experiment</a>. I wonder how often admissions committees
would agree on students?

Of course, I could have some fun with MRP (see <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf">this paper</a>),
but that would require a lot more data and a better understanding of
why people participate on Grad Cafe.
