I recently bought a desktop computer. As a first-time PC build I can
highly recommend the process.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't much of a hardware guy before starting this process and I
ended up learning quite a lot from picking out the parts and
assembling them myself. It's also quite a bit cheaper than buying an
equivalent pre-built PC and much better (performance-wise) than buying
a similarly priced laptop.
</p>

<p>
And of course, there's something about knowing that you picked out
this particular machine and assembled it with your own hands. Of all
the machines I've worked with this one is the closest to my heart.
</p>

<h2 id="org6d09121">Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6d09121">
<p>
I wanted a decent home machine that can last me a while. While I
need some computational power, I don't need too beefy of a machine.
For heavy-duty processing there's always cloud providers who provide
on-demand options. So the primary purpose was high quality
components with an eye towards budget constraints of about $1000.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org09ca636" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org09ca636">Components</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org09ca636">
<p>
I picked out my components from <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com">pcpartpicker.com</a>. There are <a href="https://medium.com/mlreview/choosing-components-for-personal-deep-learning-machine-56bae813e34a">several</a>
<a href="https://medium.com/mlreview/choosing-components-for-personal-deep-learning-machine-56bae813e34a">posts</a> bout selecting machines on the internet albeit with a bit
stronger focus on deep learning. There's also <a href="http://www.logicalincrements.com/">resources</a> more focused
on gaming. Generally I tried to interpolate between these guides and
my own considerations.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org782b6ef" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org782b6ef">CPU</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org782b6ef">
<p>
The comparable chips I looked at were the i7-8600 and Ryzen 2600. I
decided to go with AMD over Intel due to the number of cores. Given
that a large amount of my workload is embarassing parallel this
seemed like a better idea than faster clock speeds. Out of the box
R doesn't do that great of a job of using all of the cores, however
there are packages available which work quite well.
</p>

<p>
The 2600 is also cheaper and comes with a stock CPU fan which
reduces the price even further.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4f26550" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4f26550">Motherboard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f26550">
<p>
Honestly most of this was due to not wanting to deal with
potentially needing a BIOS update to support my AMD CPU which
implied a X470 board. After that it's just finding the cheapest
board that was available. I started out with a Gigabyte X470 Aorus
Ultra Gaming and ended up with an ASUS Prime X470-Pro (more about
that later).
</p>

<p>
Of all the parts I'm least clear about the important features of
motherboards. I'm not interested in overclocking or supporting
multiple GPUs so that seems to rule out most of the advantages of a
nicer motherboard.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1127510" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1127510">Graphics Card</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1127510">
<p>
The biggest splurge in the build. GPUs are really used for two
things: deep learning and gaming (assuming crypto has moved on to
ASICS). I felt the GTX 1060 6 Gb was a decent compromise between
performance and budget concerns. Like I mentioned before, I'm not
interested in having a beast of a GPU on my local machine if it
would be cheaper for me to just run jobs on the cloud. But for
small jobs a local GPU would be nice; especially for learning
purposes.

<div id="outline-container-org2d2bac3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2d2bac3">Memory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2d2bac3">
<p>
I picked up 2x8 GB DDR4-2400 RAM. I've got two more slots to
upgrade in case I need more RAM. I had been maxing out the 8Gb on
my previous machine so this will enable some analyses that I was
previously having to do contortions with to fit into RAM.

<div id="outline-container-org587b2b1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org587b2b1">Storage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org587b2b1">
<p>
I have two memory drives: one 250Gb SSD and one 2Tb HDD. The SSD is
for the OS (100Gb) and perhaps working data sets. The HDD is for
storage. I don't really use that much storage on my current
machines so 2TB should cover me for the reasonable future.

<h3 id="org0fab168">Power Supply and Case</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0fab168">
<p>
The unsexy bits of the machine. But I do have to mention my NZXT
S340 case which was surprisingly nice to work with.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4fc2513" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4fc2513">Mouse and Keyboard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4fc2513">
<p>
I wanted to try out a mechanical keyboard so I got a GK-Force K83
Red. It's actually quite satisfying to type on so I finally get the
mechanical keyboard hype (well at least the $40 hype, maybe not the
$150 hype).
</p>

<p>
Mouse is nothing special from Amazon. I have keyboard controls for
almost everything including <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">web browsing</a> so it won't necessarily
get much use.

<div id="outline-container-org21b74c1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org21b74c1">Monitor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org21b74c1">
<p>
I had originally just used an old Dell from an ancient desktop.
It's fine for my purposes but the square aspect ratio started to
grate upon me as it made split-screen awkward. So I picked up an
Acer R240HY 23.8in monitor.
</p>

<p>
I'm tempted by a two monitor setup but unfortunately my home desk
has a top which doesn't allow much clearance for monitors. As it
was my current monitor just barely fits.

<div id="outline-container-orga431eba" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga431eba">The Assembly</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga431eba">
<p>
So the assembly was, um, harrowing. It started off fine: I watched a
<a href="https://youtu.be/IhX0fOUYd8Q">tutorial</a> on YouTube and everything seemed straightforward. At its
core it's just like assembling Legos and there's labels and
instructions for everything. I got a much better understanding of
the components and setup of a computer from this process.
</p>

<p>
But apparently it wasn't so straightforward. After all the tedious
cable-plugging and screw tightening it was time to plug it in and
bask in the glory of my new machine. I turned on the power and&#x2026;.
nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
Cue panic. I immediately went to the internet to try and figure out
what was wrong. Is everything snugly plugged in? Yes. Do you have
the right cables going to the right place? Yes. Did you remove the
plastic thing on the CPU socket? What plastic thing!?!?! So I remove
the CPU fan and CPU to see that my motherboard didn't come with a
plastic thing. Except now the thermal paste on my CPU and CPU fan
needs to be reapplied so I can't put it back on. At this point I
call it a day and fret all night about bricking my expensive new
purchase.
</p>

<p>
The next day I decide to whip out my general purpose troubleshooting
tool: the credit card. I went to a local repair shop with my desktop
and had them look into the problem. A week later my machine finally
reached the top of their queue. Diagnosis: something wrong with the
CPU or motherboard, replace them.
</p>

<p>
So back to Amazon whose return policy is thankfully excellent. I
order a replacement CPU. The motherboard I originally bought is
out-of-stock and I'm not interested in waiting anymore at this point
so I pick the next least expensive board that will ship immediately.
</p>

<p>
After they arrive it's back to the assembly stage. This time was a
bit more tense as a second failed build would have been devestating.
Fortunately my girlfriend was available as a second pair of hands
and moral support. Except for screwing in the motherboard which was
considerable more painful than the first time (pro tip: remove the
case fans), the second build was more straightforward as I didn't
have to consult tutorials.
</p>

<p>
So finally the moment of truth. I turned on the power and&#x2026;.
nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
Just kidding. LEDs lit up, fans started spinning, BIOS came up on
the monitor, everything was a go. The waves of relief I felt were
undescribable. It was a long difficult road but Atlas finally lived
(yes, I name my machines).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4b5edb8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4b5edb8">The Installation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4b5edb8">
<p>
After the stress of assembly it was nice to get back to something
more in my wheelhouse: installing the OS.
</p>

<p>
My distro of choice is Arch Linux and by now I've become a veteran
of installation. At the risk of incurring more afflictions due to my
hubris I will again describe this process as straightforward. All
you do is follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">directions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately this went far better than the hardware assembly. The
only hiccup was that I apparently forgot to mount my /home directory
on my HDD and instead was writing to the SSD. I already knew how to
handle that as I had transferred a /home directory for a friend just
last week.
</p>

<p>
It also revealed yet another hardware problem: the CPU was hitting
90 degrees celsius which was quite distressing. Turns out you really
have to screw the CPU fan in very tight for it to effectively cool
the CPU. Now it reaches 40s. Yet another lesson learned. Although my
laptop's CPU hits 90 under heavy load as well which is slightly
disturbing.
