<p>
This semester I've been taking an experimental design class.
Experimental design is the specification of all aspects of an
experiment:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>which treatments to study</li>
<li>choosing blocking factors</li>
<li>choosing how to randomize</li>
<li>specifying experimental units</li>
<li>choosing treatment allocation</li>
</ul>

<p>
But how do we select those values? This is important because you can
improve estimation of particular quantities by carefully designing
aspects of the experiment.
</p>

<p>
As one of the final tasks of the course we were to give a talk about a
relevant paper. As a fervent Bayesian, I decided to look at <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177009939">Bayesian
Experimental Design: A Review</a> by Chaloner and Verdinelli (1995).
</p>

<p>
The main idea of the Bayesian approach to experimental design (and to
Bayesian inference in general) is that we should take advantage of
prior information when avaiable.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following setup:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We have some set of potential designs \(\eta\)</li>
<li>For each design \(\eta\) we would observe data \(y\) based upon the design
as well as some unknown parameters \(\theta\).</li>
<li>We then make some decision \(d\) based upon \(y\) observations.</li>
<li>Finally we'll have some measure of utility \(U(d, \theta, \eta, y)\) which
depends upon all of these quantities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now that we have a utility the most natural thing to do from a
decision-theory perspective is to optimize the expected utility.
</p>

<p>
\[ \int_{y} \int_{\theta} U(d, \theta, \eta, y) p(\theta \mid y, \eta) p(y \mid \eta) d\theta dy \]
</p>

<p>
So our best decision holding everything else fixed is whatever \(d\)
maximizes this expression. Likewise, the best design is the whatever
\(\eta\) maximizes this expression (when paired with the optimal \(d\) for
that particular \(\eta\)).
</p>

<p>
An important note is that the utility function should be chosen to
suit the goal of the experiment. For instance, there's specific
utility functions for experiments designed to simply obtain
information about the unknown parameters vs experiments designed to
perform a particular test vs fit a model which predicts well. This is
more satisfying than some of the classical designs taught in the class
which did not seem tailored towards specific purposes so much as
satisfying generally desireable criterion.
</p>

<p>
You'll note that I mention nothing about actually calculating the
expected utility. This seems to be a major limitation in using
Bayesian experimental design more broadly. It would be interesting if
there were good software for flexibly designing Bayesian experiments;
as it is, there seems to only be focus on linear models where you can
calculate the expected utility in closed form.
</p>

<p>
And that's basically all you need to know. One thing that I love about
Bayesian methods is that they're conceptually concise. Once you know a
few basic ideas you can apply them a wide array of problems. This is
in contrast to the traditional experimental design literature which
gave the impression of lacking cohesion. Although before I chalk up
another victory for the Bayesian school I should probably consider
that the vast majority of current scientific designs use the
traditional methods. So perhaps there's a beauty/practicality
tradeoff to consider.
