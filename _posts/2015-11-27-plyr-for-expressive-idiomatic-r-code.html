title: Using plyr for expressive, idiomatic R code
---


<p>
When I first encountered the <i>plyr</i> package for R, I thought it was
needless frippery. There was nothing that a well-written loop or
subset couldn't do. Then I read Hadley Wickham's <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01/v40i01.pdf">Split-Apply-Combine</a>
paper, taught <i>plyr</i> as a TA, and tried it out in my own code. I've
been converted, it's a great tool for expressive R code. It's best to
see this by example.
</p>

For my ADA work I'm working with power spectra from a large number
of recordings of neural activity in mice brains. When I'm doing my
analysis the first part of my code is loading the data. My first
approach is below.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">dfs &lt;- list()

for(ii in seq_along(files)) {
    file &lt;- files[ii]
    mouse &lt;- mice[ii]
    label &lt;- labels[ii]

    dfs[[ii]] &lt;- cbind(read_spectrum(file), mouse = mouse, label = label)
}

df &lt;- do.call(rbind, dfs)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a fairly straightforward approach. I pass a list of
filenames, mouse identifiers, and disease labels (using the
wonderful <a href="https://github.com/trevorld/argparse">argparse</a> package) and load the spectra as dataframes which
I eventually <i>rbind</i> together.
</p>

<p>
Here's the corresponding <i>plyr</i> version
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">inputs &lt;- data.frame(file = files, mouse = mice, label = labels)

df &lt;- mdply(inputs, function(file, mouse, label) {
    return(cbind(read_spectrum(file), mouse = mouse, label = label))
})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Looking at this code, it's more compact at 5 lines compared to 11
for the for loop.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">A more complicated example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Now, once I've loaded the spectra as a dataframe, I need to
aggregate them, first within mice, and then between label.
</p>

<p>
The resulting R code is a little messy.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">average_specs &lt;- function(df) {
    freqs &lt;- unique(df$frequency)
    avepower &lt;- rep(NA, length(freqs))

    for(ii in seq_along(freqs)) {
	freq &lt;- freqs[ii]
	nRecordings &lt;- nrow(df) / length(freqs)
	avepower[ii] &lt;- sum(df$power[df$frequency == freq]) / nRecordings
    }

    data.frame(frequency = freqs, power = avepower)

    return(df)
}

## Aggregate by mouse
micedfs &lt;- list()
uniqMice &lt;- unique(mice)
for(ii in seq_along(uniqMice)) {
    mouse &lt;- uniqMice[ii]
    label &lt;- df$label[df$mouse == mouse][1]

    mousedf &lt;- averageSpecs(df[df$mouse == mouse])
    mousedf$label &lt;- label
    micedfs[ii] &lt;- mousedf
}

micedf &lt;- do.call(rbind, micedfs)

## Aggregate by condition
labeldfs &lt;- list()
uniqLabels &lt;- unique(labels)
for(ii in seq_along(uniqLabels)) {
    label &lt;- uniqLabels[ii]

    labeldf &lt;- averageSpecs(micedf[micedf$label == label])
    labeldf$label &lt;- label
    labeldfs[ii] &lt;- labeldf
}

df &lt;- do.call(rbind, labeldfs)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I don't want to talk about this. It's just ugly.
</p>

<p>
This was actually the example which lead to my <i>plyr</i> epiphany. Just
look at the <i>plyr</i> version.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">average_specs &lt;- function(df) {
    df &lt;- ddply(df, .(frequency), summarize, power &lt;- mean(power))
    return(df)
}

df &lt;- ddply(specdf, .(label), function(labelsub) {
    df &lt;- ddply(specdf, .(mouse), function(mousesub) {
	df &lt;- average_specs(sub)
	return(df)
    })
    return(df)
})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Wow, that just looks nice. It's concise with very little
boilerplate. I can easily extend it to calculate other summary
statistics such as standard deviations.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Icing on the cake</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now that I've gotten the summary statistics I like to plot them.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">for(label in uniqLabels) {
    outfile &lt;- paste0(outdir, "/", label, ".pdf")

    select &lt;- df$label == label
    subdf &lt;- df[select, ]
    fig &lt;- ggplot(subdf, aes(x = frequency, y = power)) + geom_line()
    ggsave(outfile, fig)
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <i>plyr</i> version is very similar.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">d_ply(df, .(label), function(df) {
    label &lt;- df$label[1]
    outfile &lt;- paste0(outdir, "/", label, ".pdf")

    fig &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = frequency, y = power)) + geom_line()
    ggsave(outfile, fig)
})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That's nice, but not really that different. But what if I got data
from a several location in the brain and wanted to plot those
locations individually?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">for(label in uniqLabels) {
    for(location in uniqLocations) {
	select &lt;- df$label == label &amp; df$location == location
	if(any(select)) { # avoid empty df error
	    outfile &lt;- paste0(outdir, "/", label, "-", location, ".pdf")

	    subdf &lt;- df[select, ]
	    fig &lt;- ggplot(subdf, aes(x = frequency, y = power)) + geom_line()
	    ggsave(outfile, fig)
	}
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I dislike the look of this. The first four lines are too long and
I'm already at three levels of indentation.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, <i>plyr</i> handles this very gracefully.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">d_ply(df, .(label, location), function(df) {
    label &lt;- df$label[1]
    location &lt;- df$location[1]
    outfile &lt;- paste0(outdir, "/", label, , "-", location, ".pdf")

    fig &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = frequency, y = power)) + geom_line()
    ggsave(outfile, fig)
}
</pre>
</div>

Experimenting with <i>plyr</i> is a manifestation of my effort to write
more idiomatic R. Like the examples above, I find that most of the R
code that stands out to me as ugly is the result of failing to use
the correct R idiom. I haven't compared the speed of plyr. I assume
it would compare well enough, but that's somewhat beside the point.
Expressiveness and readability are the metrics that I'm trying to
optimize here.
</p>

<p>
A similar process occured with <i>ggplot2</i>. At first I thought it was
completely unnecessary. Now I feel pain at the thought of showing
people base R plots. The syntax is just so much easier and
expressive.
</p>

<p>
The common thread is that both packages are part of the
"Hadleyverse". I'll have to <a href="http://adolfoalvarez.cl/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-hadleyverse/">explore</a> further, <i>dplyr</i> and <i>tidyr</i>
seem like the logical next steps.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and just in case you're wondering, you can do some of the <a href="http://dataframesjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/split_apply_combine.html">same
things</a> in <i>julia</i>.
