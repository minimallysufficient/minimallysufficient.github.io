title: Closed proprietary software ruined (a sizeable chunk of) my day
excerpt: Matlab wasn't working so I decided to rant a little bit.

<p>
I recently got a new data dump for my ADA project. To my slight
annoyance the data came in a new file format .pl2. Things didn't get
much better from then on.

I knew immediately how to open this file: ask Google. It turns out
it's a proprietary data format. I'll save you a surprisingly long
session of searching and tell you that it can only be opened by (1)
their proprietary software (big surprise) and (2) (thankfully) a
provided SDK (for free even).
</p>

<p>
I just want to read this data and move onto real work. So I
download the Matlab SDK.
</p>

<h3 id="org81aafc5">But closed proprietary programs are even worse</h3>

<p>
Ok, so I needed to use Matlab to open the files; at least I can rely
upon Matlab being reliable, right? After all, people pay (an
extortionate amount of) money for it.
</p>

<p>
Turns out I broke Matlab. Not me personally, but a new release of
ncurses. The newest version <i>ncurses 6.0</i> was released a few weeks
ago so I get the following error message when firing up Matlab
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Not a great start. It was still looking for the old version. I try
downgrading my ncurses version; no go since everything else depends
upon the new version. Back to Google.
</p>

<p>
I found a very helpful<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=202575">thread</a> about the problem. I
download a package from the AUR and everything's good.
</p>

<p>
Now that Matlab's fixed I actually have to code something in
Matlab. This deserves a post by itself, but let's just mention the
infuriating use of parentheses for indexing, insistence on single
quotes, and the compulsion to print everything not ended with a
semi-colon.
</p>

<p>
But I finally got everything running. Time from start to finish,
about 2 hours.
</p>

<h3 id="orgf40860d">File Format: mostly harmless</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf40860d">
<p>
The file format being closed actually doesn't bother me too much.
Firstly they provide an SDK. There's even an option: C++ or Matlab.
</p>

<p>
If I had the time I'd just use the C++ code. In the midst of my
Googling I came across a press release that claimed the new format
was orders of magnitude faster than the old. If they're doing
something clever I'd rather they just give me the tools to read the
data than have to figure it out myself. I can even write
packages<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> to read this data into all sorts of languages
just using the FFI.  So they get passing marks here.
</p>

<p>
There are potential problems however. If the company ever goes out
of business your files are probably unreadable as the software
which reads the format will vanish. This is actually an interesting
problem that's not limited to closed proprietary data; it's just
that open-source software has a very long half-life: as long as
somebody has the source code it's just a visit to GitHub away.
Anyways, there's some interesting stuff about Docker images being
used to fix this problem.
</p>

<p>
So in the end this is an inconvenience, but falls pretty far down
the list of things that irk me.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org39bf157">
<p>
In contrast, I currently am wishing I could go "Office Space" on
the portion of my hard drive that contains Matlab.
</p>

<p>
In a way, it's not their fault. Software updates are released all
of the time and they can't be bothered to fix all of these issues.
Besides, most people aren't on a rolling release distro, so they
haven't updated ncurses yet.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the source code was available I'd be able to
just rebuild against the new ncurses. I probably wouldn't even need
to do it myself, the packagers for my distribution would do it for
me. All I have to do is run <i>pacman -Syu</i> and everything works
great, just like it did for every<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> other program that
depends upon ncurses.
</p>

<p>
Before you conclude I'm over-reacting, I should also provide some
context: Matlab has been a thorn in my side for a while now. Prior
to this year the closest I had gotten to Matlab had been its
open-source clone Octave<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> which I was required to use for
a machine learning course.
</p>

<p>
Then we started needing a method which is only implemented in
Matlab; it can't even run in Octave. So I dutifully installed
Matlab on my server (and it can't fit on my Chromebook which cramps
my style).
</p>

<p>
It turns out that you have to connected to the campus network to
validate the license (because $$$). Thus I have to make sure the
VPN is connected each time. This interferes with my ssh connection
such that I cannot ssh into my server from campus (and only campus)
when I'm on the VPN. I could probably fix this, but it's low on the
list of tasks.
</p>

<p>
Add on the fact that Matlab is a terrible language to read and
write. See previous on my thoughts about punctuation, esp ", <b>(</b>,
and <b>;</b>.
</p>

<p>
But by far the most insidious part of Matlab is that it's
contagious. Recall that my decision to use Matlab wasn't my idea; I
was forced to use it because others used it. If I hadn't decided to
use Matlab only to convert the data into an open format (HDF5),
then anyone wishing to use my code would be forced to use Matlab
too. I can cope, but those who aren't academics or whose
institution doesn't shell out for a site license are effectively
barred from using this method.

<h2 id="org4dbd8a5">Solutions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4dbd8a5">
<p>
So how do you fix this problem. One solution is to just use open
source software. At the very least this makes your life easier and
refrains from making the problem worse. However, there also needs
to be some effort to fix others' behavior.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this seems to be a quixotic effort. Richard Stallman
has been <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html">railing</a> against Microsoft Word for years and last time I
checked I still get .docx<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> files in my inbox. However, open
source has come a long way; with workable alternatives (ahem,
Julia) things could be different this time. At the very least it's
worth a shot.
</p>

<p>
Now let me find some more windmills to tilt at.
