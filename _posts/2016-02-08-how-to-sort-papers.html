title: How to sort papers

<p>
Part of my duties for the department involves TAing for a large
undergraduate course. At our last meeting we had a discussion about
sorting papers. It turns out I have strong opinions on the matter.
</p>

<p>
The main motivation for sorting papers is that returning papers to
students works best if the papers are returned in alphabetical order.
If the papers are in order you can make several piles such as A-H,
I-P, and Q-Z. This mitigates the feeding frenzy that occurs when you
let students pick up their papers. In theory it also lets students
find their paper using binary search, but I rarely see this actually
happen in practice.
</p>

<p>
The discussion we had at our meeting was about the optimal way to
sort. It apparently has been taking a long time. This doesn't surprise
me; I've done a lot of sorting in my time and I've found that the
choice of algorithm has a great impact on how long the task takes.
Through a good amount of trial and error I've come to find that the
best algorithm is radix sort. I'll now share my wisdom.
</p>

<h2 id="orgheadline1">Radix Sort</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
Radix sort is a comparison-free divide-and-conquer algorithm for
sorting. The implementation is very simple.
</p>

<p>
Take your stack of papers and find enough space to make 26 piles. Each
pile is associated with a single letter. Take a paper off the stack,
look at the first letter of the last name, and place the paper in the
corresponding pile. Repeat until all papers have been placed in a
pile. Now pick up a pile and sort it. If the pile is small enough you
can sort intuitively, otherwise carry out another round of radix sort,
this time using the second letter of the last name. Do this for every
pile. Now pick up the piles in order and everything is sorted.
</p>

<h3 id="orgheadline2">Semi-anytime</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
An anytime algorithm is one that will always return a valid
solution even if its interrupted. I say the radix sort is
semi-anytime because after the first step the papers are roughly in
order. All of the subsequent steps merely refine that order. This
property is nice if you run out of time before class or you don't
particularly care that the papers are <b>exactly</b> in order.
</p>

<p>
This is not the case for other algorithms such as insert sort where
if you're interrupted you'll have a sorted pile and an unsorted
pile. The students with papers are in the unsorted pile will be
angry.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
I find it hard to remember the order of the alphabet. Typically I
have to resort to (mentally) singing the nursery rhyme to keep it
straight. Most methods suffer from delays while you figure out
whether "j" is before or after "q"? For radix sort I make post-its
to label the piles so I don't have to remember anything.

<h3 id="orgheadline4">Parallelizable</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
The entire process can be done in parallel which can greatly speed
up the grading process if you have multiple workers. Workers are
also free to leave at anytime without disturbing the process. I
haven't been able to try this out, but this seems like it could be
a fun project for small children.

<h3 id="orgheadline5">Psychologically gratifying</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Each pile sorted gives a sense of achievement. This is important to
maintain morale. I also find tackling piles in decreasing size
enhances this effect as the task becomes progressively easier.

<h3 id="orgheadline7">Space requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
You need enough space to make your piles. Thus, radix sort doesn't
work well in small offices, seminars, or airplanes.
</p>

<p>
You can mitigate this problem by using fewer piles but this
requires more thought about the alphabet and requires more rounds
of sorting.

<h3 id="orgheadline8">Name distributions aren't optimal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
Radix sort works best when the piles are roughly the same size.
Unfortunately, the distribution of the letters in last names is not
uniform. This results in a few piles being rather large (M and S)
while some are small or even empty (U and X).

For fun I'd like to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_sort">spaghetti sort</a>. On the first day of
class I would give every student a rod whose length corresponds to
their alphabetical order. When submitting assignments they would
fasten their work to their rod and hand in the rod. Then sorting is
as simple as laying out the rods and pulling out the longest rod in
order. Bonus points if you can tell me how I could account for
dropping/adding students.
