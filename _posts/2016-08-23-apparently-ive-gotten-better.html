I was organizing my hard drive and came across one of the first julia
programs I ever wrote. It turns out this actually was quite a while
ago; the timestamp is July 5, 2013. It was an enlightening exercise
reading the code and then rewriting it with the benefit of three more
years of experience.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1">Old Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
So here's the code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-julia">old_version = <span style="color: #4c83ff;">function</span>(n)

    field = trues(n)

    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">for</span> i <span style="color: #4c83ff;">in</span> primes(n)
        field[i] = <span style="color: #96CBFE;">false</span>
        x = 1
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">while</span> i + 2x*x &lt;= n
            field[i + 2x*x] = <span style="color: #96CBFE;">false</span>
            x += 1
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>

    i = 3

    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">while</span> i &lt; n
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">if</span> field[i]
            <span style="color: #4c83ff;">return</span>(i)
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
        i += 2
    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>

    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">return</span>(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"Unsuccessful"</span>)

<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let me start off by saying, while I would be embarrassed by this code
today, I think it's not bad for a beginner. 
</p>

<p>
I'm going to slightly obscure the purpose behind the
program <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Suffice to say that I'm looking for the first
odd composite number that can't be written as the sum of a prime
number and twice a perfect square. The interesting stuff isn't the
code anyways, it's the style. Here are some things to note:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The spacing is huge; this was the first thing that struck me. It's
only 25 lines, but it just feels really spread out.</li>
<li>It's obvious that I'm coming from R. I end up define an anonymous
function (back when they were slow) and return a tuple. Why? Because
that's what the R code would look like.</li>
<li>I name things terribly; what is n? Also, I use single letter
variable names.</li>
<li>I have bad algorithmic thinking. I make it needlessly more
complicated than I should have; see the new code below.</li>
<li>No type stability. I either return an integer or an ASCII string.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="orgheadline2">New Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
Ok, presumably I've learned a few things over the past couple years.
I should be able to do better. So I rewrote it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-julia"><span style="color: #4c83ff;">function</span> <span style="color: #ff1493;">new_version</span>(searchMax)
    mask = primesmask(searchMax)

    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">for</span> ii = 3:2:searchMax
        mask[ii] &amp;&amp; <span style="color: #4c83ff;">continue</span>
        xx = 1
        pairFound = <span style="color: #96CBFE;">false</span>
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">while</span> !pairFound &amp;&amp; ii - 2xx^2 &gt; 0
            xx += 1;
            pairFound = mask[ii - 2xx^2]
        <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
        !pairFound &amp;&amp; <span style="color: #4c83ff;">return</span> ii
    <span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>

    throw(ErrorException(<span style="color: #61CE3C;">"No cases found below $searchMax"</span>))
<span style="color: #4c83ff;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's shorter, more idiomatic, understandable, and runs faster.
</p>

<p>
It also just feels better. I can't quite explain it, but just
looking at the code blocks from a distance, not even reading them,
the second feels good. I seem to have developed taste idiosyncratic
as it may be.

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
This raises the question, what if I come back to this code in three
more years? Will I have the same reaction as I did to my previous
one? Or will the learning curve have leveled off?
</p>

<p>
For short stuff like this I probably can't do much better. There are
only so many ways to write it. However, I might become better at
writing larger projects. Or I might switch paradigms; perhaps three
years from now I'll wonder at my naivete in writing imperative
programs.
