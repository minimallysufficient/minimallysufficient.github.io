#+TITLE: Fun with Grad Cafe data
#+DESCRIPTION:
#+CATEGORIES:

My classmate [[http://www.statisticalsignal.com][Lee Richardson]] and I were discussing the website [[http://thegradcafe.com][GradCafe]]
last night and their database of admissions decisions. This morning he
sent me a link to an R package [[http:://cran.r-project.org/package=brewdata][brewdata]] which scrapes results off the
site, cleans it, and puts it into a nice R dataframe.

Because I have nothing better to do [fn:todo] I decided to have some
fun with the data.

* Warnings
  - This data is cool, but it's a non-probability sample. That means
    that any conclusions we might draw don't necessarily
    generalize[fn:MRP] to the broader population of applicants to
    statistics programs.
  - Don't take this as an endorsement of GradCafe. If you're currently
    in the process of waiting for admissions decisions, under no
    circumstances should you look at GradCafe. Relax, enjoy your
    senior year of college or current job, and know that anxiously
    refreshing your browser to see the latest news does nothing for
    your admissions chances.
* The Data
  I'm going to focus on 2014 data which has data on 589 applications.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC R :session gradcafe :exports none
    require(brewdata)

    dta <- brewdata(year = 2014)
    dta <- dta[dta$gpa != 0, ]
    dta$uniqid <- paste0(dta$gpa, "-", dta$gre_v, "-", dta$gre_q, "-", dta$gre_aw)

    applications <- by(dta, dta$uniqid, nrow)
    admittances <- by(dta, dta$uniqid, function(x) sum(x$decision == "A"))
  #+END_SRC

  To enable me to answer some of the questions I'm going to try and
  identify unique individuals. To do this I used the reported GPA and
  GRE scores to pick out individuals. If two records share the same
  GPA and GRE scores then I declare them to be from the same
  individual. This gives me 128 individuals with a total of 241
  applications to 62 schools.

* Questions
** When do you hear back? 
   Part of the reason why I suggest that people avoid looking at
   GradCafe during admissions seasons is that it leads to anxiety. The
   longer you wait and the more acceptances you see on the website,
   the more likely you expect to be denied. Equipped with data, we can
   examine the veracity of this belief.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :session gradcafe :results output :exports results
     table(dta$mon, dta$decision)
   #+END_SRC

   As we see, if you're lucky enough to get a response in December
   you're sure to be admitted. January is still early and has more
   acceptances than rejections. February and March have more
   rejections, but not dramatically so. Sad to say, April doesn't hold
   much hope.

   So it seems that waiting for a response isn't necessarily a sign of
   disappointment. Just don't wait too long.

** How many places do people apply to?
   When I was in the middle of application season I heard a couple
   different approaches to choosing which schools to apply to. Some
   people preferred the "shotgun" approach of applying to as many
   schools as possible in order to "maximize" their likelihood of
   acceptance. Personally I went with the "only apply if you would
   want to go there" approach, but I am curious which approach
   dominates.
   
   It seems that the majority of Grad Cafe participants apply to only
   one school. I suspected that this is not actually true, rather
   people are only reporting the school at which they were admitted
   and accepted. However, 39 out of the 85 individuals that applied to
   only one school were denied.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :session gradcafe :results graphics :exports results :file img/applications.png
   hist(applications, xlab = "\"Applications\"", main = "How many places do people apply to?")
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:img/applications.png]]

   Of course, I would be remiss from confirming the obvious. The
   correlation between acceptances and applications is $0.6639914$. To
   borrow from Gretzsky, "You get denied at 100% of the schools you
   don't apply to."

** How important are GRE scores?
   Since we're having fun, I'll fit a logistic regression to see how
   important grades and test scores. Don't put any stock into the
   statistical significance of GPA.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :session gradcafe :results output :exports results
     model <- glm((decision == "A") ~ scale(gpa) + scale(gre_v) + scale(gre_q) + scale(gre_aw), family = binomial, data = dta)

     summary(model)
   #+END_SRC

   I don't particularly like this model, specifically the linearity of
   the scores. I imagine that a cutoff model would be more
   appropriate. However, this means little when considering the larger
   issue: omitted variable bias. We have no data on letters of
   recommendation, previous research experiences, undergrad
   institution, etc. I suspect that these have a larger impact on
   admission decisions than test scores.

* Discussion
  
  This gets to a greater questions: how random are grad school
  admissions? The data that we have available is a good summary of
  some of the objective measures of applications: GPA and test scores.
  But there's all of the subjective aspects to consider. This reminds
  me of the [[http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html][NIPS experiment]]. I wonder how often admissions committees
  would agree on students?
   
* Footnotes

[fn:MRP] Of course, I could have some fun with MRP (see [[http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf][this paper]]),
but that would require a lot more data and a better understanding of
why people participate on Grad Cafe.

[fn:todo] Not true, but playing with data is more fun than measure
theory.
